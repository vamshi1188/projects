  You are an expert C++ developer tasked with refining the following unit tests.
  Please improve these tests by:
  
  1. Removing any duplicate tests
  2. Adding missing includes and dependencies
  3. Ensuring proper test fixture setup and teardown
  4. Improving test coverage for edge cases
  5. Following Google Test best practices
  
  Here are the tests to refine:
  
  {{TESTS}}
  
  Please make the following improvements:
  
  - Ensure all tests follow the naming convention: [Method]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedResult]
  - Add appropriate comments explaining the purpose of each test
  - Make sure all test fixtures have proper setup and teardown methods
  - Ensure all tests are independent and don't rely on state from other tests
  - Add tests for edge cases that might not be covered
  - Remove any redundant or duplicate tests
  - Ensure all necessary mocks and test doubles are properly implemented
  - Add appropriate assertions with descriptive failure messages
  
  Format your response as complete test files, with each file starting with a comment line:
  // Filename: test_filename.cc
  
  Include all necessary includes and dependencies in each test file.
