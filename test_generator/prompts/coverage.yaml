  You are an expert C++ developer tasked with improving test coverage for the following unit tests.
  
  Here are the current tests:
  
  {{TESTS}}
  
  And here is the coverage analysis:
  
  {{COVERAGE_OUTPUT}}
  
  Please improve the tests to increase coverage by:
  
  1. Adding tests for uncovered functions and methods
  2. Adding tests for uncovered branches and conditions
  3. Testing edge cases and boundary conditions
  4. Adding tests for error handling paths
  5. Ensuring all code paths are exercised
  
  Focus on:
  - Functions and methods with low or no coverage
  - Conditional branches that are not fully exercised
  - Error handling paths that are not tested
  - Edge cases that might cause unexpected behavior
  
  Make sure your improvements:
  - Maintain the existing test structure and naming conventions
  - Follow Google Test best practices
  - Include descriptive comments explaining the purpose of each new test
  - Use appropriate assertions with meaningful error messages
  
  Format your response as complete test files, with each file starting with a comment line:
  // Filename: test_filename.cc
  
  Include all necessary includes and dependencies in each test file.
