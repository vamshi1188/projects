README for Booking-app Go Project
Project: Booking-app

Language: Go

Description: This project is a simple Go application that simulates a conference ticket booking system. Users can enter their information and book tickets for the "go conference". The application tracks the remaining tickets and validates user input.

Features:

Book tickets for the "go conference"
Check remaining ticket availability
Validate user information (name, email, number of tickets)
Store booking information
Simulate sending ticket confirmation emails
Getting Started:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/vamshi1188/projects/tree/main/Booking-app
Go to the project directory: cd Booking-app
Run the application: go run main.go
How it works:

The application first greets the user and displays the conference name and available tickets. The user can then enter their name, email, and desired number of tickets. The application validates the input and, if valid, books the tickets and sends a simulated confirmation email. The application keeps track of the remaining tickets and stops accepting bookings when all tickets are sold out.

Dependencies:

This project doesn't require any external dependencies beyond the standard Go libraries.

Additional Notes:

This is a basic example and could be extended with features like user authentication, different ticket types, payment processing, etc.
The "sendTicket" function currently only simulates sending an email and doesn't actually integrate with an email service.
I hope this README file is helpful and informative! Let me know if you have any questions.
